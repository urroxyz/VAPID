00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.128
Let's get together and we'll make
a regular hotel out of this place.

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:07.163
I'll put writing paper in the hotel, and next year
if you behave yourselves, I'll put in envelopes.

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:10.472
I'm gonna put extra blankets free in all
your rooms. There'll be no cover charge.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:14.742
Think of the
opportunities here in Florida.

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.443
Three years ago I came to Florida
without a nickel in my pocket.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.316
And now I've got a nickel in my pocket.
That's all very well, Mr. Hammer,

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.823
but we haven't been paid
in two weeks and we want our wages.

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:26.883
Wages? Do you wanna be
wage slaves? Answer me that.

00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.727
No. No, of course not.
Well, what makes wage slaves?
