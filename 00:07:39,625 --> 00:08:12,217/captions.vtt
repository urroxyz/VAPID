See that? I keep them
dancing for their money.

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:05.034
Jamison, I'm going down
to meet the 4:15.

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:07.699
If I never come back, you'll know I'm
still waiting for the train. Yes, sir.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:11.972
And in my absence, I'm relying on you to take good
care of everything. You can depend upon me, sir.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.913
That's fine. If any guests come in, take
good care of them. And think of me, Jamison.

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:17.917
You bet I will.
I'll be back someday.

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.045
All right. Keep a light burning in
the window, if you can find a window.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.453
All right, sir. Good-bye.
Good-bye, Jamison.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.592
Hello, Harvey.
Why so downhearted?
