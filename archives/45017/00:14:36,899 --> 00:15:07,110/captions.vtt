For a brief moment, the first men on the Moon
stand and look at the stark, lonely landscape

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.331
around them, an experience which no one before
them can share. But there is much to be done

00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:18.491
in the limited time which they can stay on
this airless, cloudless satellite of Earth.

00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:24.221
This sheet of metal foil traps and holds particles

barrage of solar energy which constantly strikes
the Moon's surface. Results of this experiment
