00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.661
toward this day of accomplishment. The great
Saturn V rocket and the complex Apollo spacecraft

00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:10.351
had been assembled together and moved to the
launch pad. The equipment and techniques and

00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:16.821
personnel had been proved in earlier missions
and now they were ready. The astronauts chosen

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:21.451
for this mission had flown it many times in
ground-based simulators. They had all been

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:30.771
in space before. They had trained carefully
and well and now they too were ready.
