Is Bob Adams cutting
you out with Polly Potter?

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:07.696
I'm not worried about a hotel clerk. No, but
I'll bet you're worried about the Potter millions.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:11.938
You generally could use money in
the old days. Oh, lay off that stuff.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:15.175
You know, marrying Polly is the only
way for you to square your debts.

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.911
I can take care of myself.
I doubt it.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:24.715
Suppose I have a little plan that'll
take care of both of us. What do you mean?

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.521
Have you ever seen that diamond
necklace of Mrs. Potter's?

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.688
You bet I have.
What's that got to do with us?
