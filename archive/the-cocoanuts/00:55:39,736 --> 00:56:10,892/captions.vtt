00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.901
a 14-foot "backage"
and a mighty fine gobbet.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.200
Now, what am I offered for this lot?
Anything at all? Anything at all?

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:08.741
$ 200.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.936
Ah, a gentleman bids $ 200.
Who'll say 300?

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.378
$300.

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.875
Another gentleman says $300.
Do I hear four?

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.919
$ 400.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:25.056
Well, the auction is practically over.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.457
It's all over but the shooting.
I'll attend to that later.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:31.156
- $ 500.
- Do I hear 600?
