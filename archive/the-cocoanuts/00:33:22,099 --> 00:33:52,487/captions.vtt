00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.992
I'll tell you, if you don't hear from
me by next Friday, the whole thing's off.

00:00:04.538 --> 00:00:08.736
I don't think I understand.
I mean, your eyes... your eyes,

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.006
they shine like the pants
of a blue serge suit.

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.604
What? That's an insult.

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:17.947
That's not a reflection on you.
That's on the pants.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.418
What I meant was
if we had a nice bungalow...

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.718
and I came home from work
and you were standing by the gate...

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:27.249
No, you came home from work
and I was standing by the gate.

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:30.388
That's more like it.
And we came down the path...
