00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.197
Aunt Fanny had an eight-pound boy.
Can you come to the wedding?"

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.831
You see, everything is all right, boys.
Everything is all right.

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.535
You're all invited to the wedding
of Aunt Fanny's eight-pound boy.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.011
Hooray! Oh, but that won't
be for a couple of years yet.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.107
In the meantime, I want you
to buck up, get down to work.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.118
Let's put this thing
over with a bang.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:22.019
And above all,
forget about money.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.616
Don't think of it. Just forget about
it, because you won't get it anyway.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.422
Hooray. Hooray.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.429
Hooray!
