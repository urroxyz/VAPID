00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.163
All right... Come over here, Rand McNally,
and I'll explain this thing to you.

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:07.469
Now look, this is a map and diagram
of the whole Cocoanut section.

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:12.035
This whole area is within a radius of
approximately three-quarters of a mile.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:16.879
Radius. Is there a remote possibility
that you know what radius means?

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.216
It's a W.J.Z.
Well, I walked right into that one.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.155
It's gonna be a cinch explaining the
rest of this thing to you, I can see that.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.921
I catch on quick.
That's a rodeo you're thinking of.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:31.192
Look, Einstein.
Here's Cocoanut Manor.
