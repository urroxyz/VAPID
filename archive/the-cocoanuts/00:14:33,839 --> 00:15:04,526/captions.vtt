But only for a little while,
Mother.

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:06.435
Why a daughter of mine should
fool around with a hotel clerk...

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.304
when she has the opportunity of
marrying one of the Boston Yates...

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:11.310
is more than I can understand,

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.347
Oh, who cares
about the Boston Yates?

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.974
Anyway, Bob isn't a clerk.
He's an architect.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.712
He's only clerking
until he can get started.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:22.812
One who clerks, Polly,
is a clerk, and that settles it.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.082
And I want you to remember
that no Potter...

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.687
has ever been involved
in a single scandal.
