00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
My dear, Mr. Hammer, I shall never
get married before my daughter.

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:07.169
You did once.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.901
Oh, but I love you.
I love you.

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:11.569
Can't you see how
I'm pining for you?

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:13.806
What in the world
is the matter with you?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.112
Oh, I'm not myself tonight.
I don't know who I am.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.119
One false move and I'm yours.

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:23.918
I love you.
I love you anyhow.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.652
I don't think you'd love me
if I were poor.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.752
I might, but I'd keep
my mouth shut.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.458
I'll not stay here any longer
and be insulted this way.
