00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.433
You understand?
That's fine.

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.664
Now, right over here,
this is the residential section.

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.763
People live there, huh?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.035
No, that's the stockyards.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.475
Now all along here,
this is the riverfront,

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:15.504
and all along the river... all along
the river, those are all levees.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.812
That's the Jewish neighborhood?

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:21.316
Well, we'll pass over that.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.322
You're a peach, boy.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.089
Now, here is a little peninsula, and here
is a viaduct leading over to the mainland.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.789
Why a duck?
I'm all right. How are you?
