1,100. There's a gentleman with
astigmatism. Twelve once? Come on.

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:05.264
$1,200.
Twelve, hail and farewell.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.466
<i>Who'll say 13? Come on.</i>

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:10.999
<i>I'll bid...
Thirteen? Do I hear 13?</i>

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.672
Twelve? Twelve once.
Twelve twice.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:17.706
Sold to Mr. Adams for $1,200. And a mighty
fine piece of property you got there, buddy.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.218
<i>Oh, Bob, you've got it!
Make a note of that.</i>

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:23.347
What happened?
I protest against that.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:27.121
I didn't have a chance to bid. What do you mean?
I want you to understand I don't discriminate.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:30.561
You had the same opportunity
as everybody else. Mr. Hammer.
