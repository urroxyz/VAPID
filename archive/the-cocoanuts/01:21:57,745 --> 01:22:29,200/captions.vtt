00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
Mr. Hammer will now act
as master of ceremonies.

00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:06.063
Mr. Hammer.

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:13.806
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:15.610
Two hundred dollars.

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:18.379
In behalf of the Rotary Club
of Minneapolis,

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:21.683
I want to take this occasion
of welcoming you to Waukegan.

00:00:21.755 --> 00:00:26.192
No, no, I mean, in recognition of my
many years of service with the railroad,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.353
you have presented me
with these ties.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.455
And that, of course, reminds me
of the story of the Irishman.
