00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.595
<v Speaker 1>We wanna see you, Mr. Hammer. <v Mr. Hammer>What's
the matter? Somebody pay their bill?

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.537
<v Others>We want our money! <v Speaker 1>Yes, money!

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.700
<v Mr. Hammer>You want your money?
<v Speaker 1>We wanna get paid.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.973
<v Mr. Hammer>Oooh, you want <i>my</i> money. Is that
fair? Do I want your money?

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.482
Suppose George Washington's soldiers had asked
for money? Where would this country be today?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.041
<v Speaker 1>But they did ask.
<v Mr. Hammer>And where's Washington?

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.113
No, my friends, no. Money will never make you
happy, and happy will never make you money.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.182
That might be a wisecrack,
but I doubt it.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.490
<v Others>We want our money!

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:33.124
<v Mr. Hammer>I'll make you all a promise. If you'll all stick
with me and work hard, we'll forget about money!
