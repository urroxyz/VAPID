00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.264
No matter what you say,
this is Cocoanut Manor.

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:05.099
Here's Cocoanut Manor.
Here's Cocoanut Heights.

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:07.037
That's a swamp.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:11.237
And right over here where the road
forks, that's Cocoanut Junction.

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.973
Where have you got
Cocoanut Custard?

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.981
That's on one of the forks.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.109
You probably eat with your knife,
so you won't have to worry about that.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.882
Now, here is the main road
leading out of Cocoanut Manor.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.014
That's the road
I wish you were on.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.457
Now, over here on this site we're
gonna build an eye and ear hospital.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:30.257
This is gonna be
a sight for sore eyes.
