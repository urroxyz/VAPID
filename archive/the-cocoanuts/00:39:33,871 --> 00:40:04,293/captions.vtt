00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.934
Hide it?
Just for a few days.

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.993
Yes, but where?
Anywhere but in here.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.334
Hide it?
I know just the place.

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.000
A hollow tree stump about a mile
from here. Will that do?

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.306
Fine, but how do I get there? It's
Cocoanut Manor. You've been out there.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.212
I'm not so sure, Harvey.
Here, I'll show you.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.810
Now, you... you go
right out Cocoanut Road.

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:21.820
Then there's Augustine Road,
like this,

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.413
but instead,
you take the Granada Road.

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:28.188
Suddenly, you come to a clearing
with a fringe of trees around it.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.422
That's Cocoanut Manor
where the stump is.
