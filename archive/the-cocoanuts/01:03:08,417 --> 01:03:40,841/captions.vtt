Bob, last night when you told me that
you'd taken it, I just couldn't believe it.

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:07.103
Told you I'd taken what?
Why, Polly, she's out of her mind.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:10.007
It sounds quite plausible to me.
Mother.

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:14.173
He didn't know what he was doing.
I begged him to take it back.

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:17.513
Say, I'm not gonna stand
for any more of this.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.848
Why, the whole thing
is ridiculous.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.480
It's absurd!

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.650
Do you people really think
for one moment that...

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:29.754
Oh, I... I don't care what
you think, any of you.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.424
Polly, you know it's a lie,
don't you?
