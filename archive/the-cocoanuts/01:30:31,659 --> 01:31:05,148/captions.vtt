He wrote it just now,

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:05.738
but he wrote another yesterday
when a necklace was stolen.

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:09.674
They are both in his handwriting.
Let me read it to you.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.735
It shows how to get to Cocoanut Manor
and the hollow tree stump...

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:16.078
and reads,
"Hollow stump, jewels."

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.811
I don't believe it.
See for yourself.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.082
Yates is gone.
Yates is gone?

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.920
And I gave him a check this morning
for a thousand dollars.

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:29.428
It's a good thing it was my
personal check. Mr. Hammer.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:33.489
There's a man outside who wants to see you
with a black mustache. Tell him I've got one.
