You know, Berryman practically built Palm Beach
and Miami, but he said he wouldn't touch this.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:08.797
Now when a man like that passes
a place up, no one wants it.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:13.710
Do you know anything about
architecture? No, but I'd love to learn.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.876
Well, I made a drawing
of the whole place showing the hills.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:22.513
It's a built-up scheme, without cutting
down the hill or having it get in the way.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.752
I made the hill fit in
with the architectural scheme.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.850
I sent Berryman a copy last week,

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:30.760
and his secretary wrote me a nice note
saying they were studying my plans.
