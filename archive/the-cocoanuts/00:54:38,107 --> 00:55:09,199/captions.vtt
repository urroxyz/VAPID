00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.934
After the entertainment,
there'll be sandwiches.

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.062
But remember, if there are no lots
sold, there will be no sandwiches.

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:09.473
Florida, folks... sunshine, sunshine.
Perpetual sunshine all the year around.

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:12.103
Let's get the auction started
before we get a tornado.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.874
Right this way.
Step forward, everybody.

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:17.247
Friends, you are now in Cocoanut Manor,
one of the finest cities in Florida.

00:00:17.318 --> 00:00:20.082
Of course, we still need a few
finishing touches, but who doesn't?

00:00:20.154 --> 00:00:24.022
This is the heart of the residential district.
Every lot is a stone's throw from the station.

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.719
As soon as they throw enough stones,
we're gonna build a station.

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:29.285
800 wonderful residences
will be built right here.

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.092
Why, they're as good as up.
Better.
