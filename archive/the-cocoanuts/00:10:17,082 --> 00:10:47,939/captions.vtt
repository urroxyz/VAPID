That's thrilling.
Does Mr. Hammer know about it?

00:00:02.303 --> 00:00:06.330
Not yet. But if he takes it,
I'll design the buildings.

00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:08.341
Say, I may be an architect yet.

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.970
If he only does, I'm sure it will be
the most beautiful place in the world.

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:15.743
It would be...
if you lived there.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:19.149
Look, see what I've written?

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.984
"Heaven for Polly and me."

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:25.457
That looks great.
When do I move in?

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.586
Any day now.
It's a lovely dream, Bob.

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.857
Let's make it come true.
