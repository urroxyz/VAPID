00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.161
How are you gonna pay for
your room? That's your lookout.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:05.500
Oh, you're just an idle "roomer."

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.403
Well, you see, we come here
to make money.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.272
I read in the paper and it say,
"Big Boom In Florida." So we come.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:13.835
We're a couple of big booms too. I'll
show you how you can make some real money.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:17.441
I'm going to hold an auction
in a little while in Cocoanut Manor.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:21.817
<i>You know what an auction is, eh? I
come from Italy on the Atlantic Auction.</i>

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.188
Well, let's go ahead
as if nothing happened.

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:27.192
I say I'm holding an auction
at Cocoanut Manor.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.558
And when the crowd gathers around,
I want you to mingle with them.

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.065
Don't pick their pockets, just mingle
with them... I'll find time for both.
