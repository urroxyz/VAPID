00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.232
It's so funny.
I wish I could think of it.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:06.398
Oft in the stilly night,

00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:08.965
the trembling of a leaf
can be heard...

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:11.375
sighing through the trees.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.710
And the babbling brook,
as it wends its way onward,

00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:16.841
babbling and...

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:24.725
Well, I got rid of one.

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:27.727
And one like that is worth
three ordinary ones. Where was I?

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.888
Oh, yes, on this chair.
That's right.

00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:32.899
Western cattle opened
at 15 and a quarter.
