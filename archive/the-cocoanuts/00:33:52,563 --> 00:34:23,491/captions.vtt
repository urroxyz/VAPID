and we went inside
and the shades were drawn...

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.729
and the lights were low,
and, uh... then, uh...

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:08.672
Are you sure
your husband's dead?

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:11.870
Why, yes.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.142
There seems to be a trace
of uncertainty in that "yes."

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:18.582
You know, a yes like that was once
responsible for me jumping out of a window.

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:22.349
And I'm not the jumper
I used to be.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:27.985
What I meant was, you're gonna be here all
winter and I'm stuck with the hotel anyhow,

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.928
why don't you grab me until
you can make other arrangements?
