00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.264
Well, maybe we can
cut out the auction.

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.803
Here's what I mean. If
somebody says $100, you say two.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.862
If somebody says two, you say three.
Bid up.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.966
That's right. Now, if nobody says
anything, then you start it off.

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:14.241
How am I gonna know when they no say
nothin'? Well, they'll probably notify you.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.782
You fool, if they don't say anything,
you'll hear 'em, won't you?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.513
Well, maybe I no listen.
Well, don't tell 'em.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:24.523
Now then, if we're successful in disposing of
these lots, I'll see that you get a nice commission.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.186
And how about some money?
Well, you can have your choice.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.991
Now, in arranging these lots,
of course, we use blueprints.
