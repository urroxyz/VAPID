You told me about this yesterday.
I know, but I left out a comma. Look.

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:07.640
In a little while we're gonna hold an auction sale at
Cocoanut Manor, the suburb terrible... uh, beautiful.

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:11.007
You must come over. There's gonna be
entertainment, sandwiches and the auction.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.342
If you don't like auctions,
we can play contract.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:17.372
Here it is. Cocoanut Manor, 42
hours from Times Square by railroad.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.943
1,600 miles as the crow flies,
1,800 as the horseflies.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:25.151
There you are, Cocoanut Manor glorifying
the American sewer and the Florida sucker.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.820
Why, it's the most exclusive residential
district in Florida. Nobody lives there.

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:32.127
And the climate... Ask me about the
climate, I dare you. Very well. How...
