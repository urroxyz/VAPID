Well, I think you
will want to see him.

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.762
His name is Mr. John W. Berryman.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:08.706
He has accepted my architectural plans
for the development of Cocoanut Manor.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.335
Well, happy days, old boy.
Thank you. Thank you.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.743
Thank you.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:18.083
He also wants to know if you can
accommodate 400 guests for the weekend.

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.244
400 guests?
400 guests.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.880
What in the world's
the matter...

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:25.015
Mother, you must admit
you were mistaken.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.151
Mr. Adams, how can you
ever forgive me?

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.355
Oh, please, Mrs. Potter.
