You know what a blueprint
is, huh? It's oysters.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.306
How is it you never got double
pneumonia? I go around by myself.

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:11.873
Do. You know what a lot is?
Yeah, it's too much.

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:14.778
I don't mean a whole lot.
Just a little lot with nothing on it.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.749
Anytime you got a too much, you got a
whole lot. Look, I explain it to you.

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:20.218
Sometimes you no got a enough.
Sometimes you got a whole lot.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:22.152
Sometimes you got a little bit.
You no think it's enough.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.816
Somebody else maybe think it's
a too much. It's a whole lot too.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:28.487
Now, a whole lot is a too much,
too much is a whole lot. Same thing.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:31.588
The next time I see you, remind
me not to talk to you, will you?
