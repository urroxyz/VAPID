00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.991
How about Uncle Dick?

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.264
Polly, it's a well-known fact...

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:08.468
that your uncle was drunk at the time.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:12.034
<i>And another thing, young lady, I'm quite
tired of your sitting out on the beach...</i>

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.205
<i>all hours of the night.</i>

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:17.910
Hey. Hey. Why don't you take
something for that insomnia?

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:21.318
You ought to cut out drinking
so much coffee. I'm sorry, sir.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:25.324
Say, any luck with the 4:30? Yes, it didn't
hit me. That's the only luck I had with it.

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.622
Mr. Hammer, I think I know
what's wrong with the hotel.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.663
I think I know too. You're fired.
Get your hat and my coat and get out.
