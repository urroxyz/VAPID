00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.594
Wait a minute.
Don't kill them yet.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.070
I've got an idea.
About them?

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:07.369
Mm-hmm. Listen.

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:10.239
When the necklace is found missing,
someone's got to be blamed.

00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:13.109
Why not them?
Gee, that's not bad.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.205
But have you got anything definite?

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.343
Suppose I flirt with them and
they come to my room. Then what?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.388
I'll complain to the management.

00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:24.947
Then on the night the necklace disappeared
they were seen near Mrs. Potter's.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.118
Get it?
You bet I get it.

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:31.062
That's a grand idea.
Thanks, kind sir.
