00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.969
Mr. Hammer, I've been robbed.

00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:04.971
What?

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:08.133
My necklace in your hotel...
Oh, Mother.

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:10.837
It's worth $100,000.

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:14.608
Was it valuable?
"Was it valuable"?

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:17.173
I'll give a thousand dollars' reward
for its return.

00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.118
You hear that? This little lady
has lost a necklace worth $100,000,

00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.621
and she offers a thousand dollars'
reward for its return.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.853
2,000. Sold for $ 2,000.
Make a note of that.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:29.225
Comin' through.
I'll take charge of this.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:32.788
All you people get back and give
us plenty of room and keep quiet.
