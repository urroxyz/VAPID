00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.401
Florida feeds the nation, but nobody feeds
me and that's what I wanna talk to you about.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.768
Mr. Hammer... Another thing,
take our cattle raising.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.707
I don't mean anything personal. But
here is the ideal cattle raising section.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.336
We have longhorns, shorthorns
and shoehorns.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.505
Mr. Hammer, will you let me
say something, please?

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.277
I hardly think so, and there's something
else I wanna bring to your mind.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.047
Where will you be when you're 65?
That's only about three months from now.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.682
If I were to buy, I should prefer
someplace like Palm Beach.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:28.194
Palm Beach? The Atlantic City of
yesterday? The slums of tomorrow?

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.253
Do you know that the population of
Cocoanut Beach has doubled in the past week?
