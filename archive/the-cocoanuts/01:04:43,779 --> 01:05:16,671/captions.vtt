00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.934
Mr. Yates?
Yes, Mrs. Potter?

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:05.529
My daughter has reconsidered
her answer to you. Mother!

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:08.439
Your engagement
will be announced tonight.

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.477
That's wonderful, Polly.

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:13.843
I shall give a dinner at the hotel...
A dinner? A dinner?

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:16.883
You want the 30- or 40-cent
dinner? You may invite everyone.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.544
It's 50 with Jell-O,
and, oh, how you can Jell-O.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.386
In honor of the engagement of my
daughter to Mr. Harvey Yates. I see.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:26.392
Let me be the last
to congratulate you, and you too.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.156
I'm sure you'll have
a very dismal wedding.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.892
Congratulations, Yates.
Congratulations, Polly.
