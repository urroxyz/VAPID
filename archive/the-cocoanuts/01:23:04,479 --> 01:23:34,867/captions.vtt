00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.662
Yearlings and spring veal
showed a firm tone.

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:05.705
And eggs were a little touchy
on a falling market.

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.935
Well, my mother and father talked it
over, and they finally moved to New York.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.102
They took a little house in the Bronx.

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:15.444
And it was in that little house that Abraham
Lincoln was born, much to my father's surprise.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:19.383
And that, boys and girls, was
the beginning of the Lincoln Highway.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:22.216
And now, friends, in view of the fact
that Miss Potter's engagement...

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.723
is being celebrated here tonight,
so to speak,

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.726
I think a few words from her mother
would be revolting.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.388
I now take great pleasure
in presenting to you...
