the well-preserved
and partially pickled Mrs. Potter.

00:00:02.837 --> 00:00:05.772
Come on now. Give the little
girl a big hand. Speech. Speech.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.774
Big speech.
Speech. Speech.

00:00:07.842 --> 00:00:10.106
My good, good friends,

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:12.270
if I could only tell you...

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:16.407
how rosy-hued everything
seems to me tonight.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:22.853
<i>As I look into your faces,
they're all lit with gay laughter.</i>

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.954
The whole world,
and everything in it,

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.625
is bathed in a soft,
glowing, luminous haze.
