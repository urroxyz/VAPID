Maybe the season hasn't started yet.
Maybe the hotel hasn't opened yet.

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:06.405
Don't worry, Mr. Hammer.
In a few weeks you'll be cleaning up.

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:10.273
Yes, and making the beds. Go on, get out
of here. I can handle this rush myself.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:13.540
600 rooms in the hotel and you have to
sleep here. How do you do, Mr. Hammer?

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:16.446
Why don't you whistle at the crossing?
You're just the woman I'm looking for.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.314
Now whether you like it or not, I'm
gonna tell you about Florida real estate.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:23.152
It's the first time it's ever been
mentioned down here, today. I'm sorry, but...

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:27.125
Do you know that property values
have increased 1929 since 1,000%?

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.889
Do you know that this is the biggest
development since Sophie Tucker?

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:34.093
Do you know that Florida is the show spot of America
and Cocoanut Beach is the black spot of Florida?
