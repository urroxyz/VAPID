I'm glad you brought it up. Our motto is,
Cocoanut Beach... no snow, no ice and no business.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.065
Do you know that Florida is the
greatest state in the Union? Is it?

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.268
Take its climate. No, we took that.
Take its fruits, take the alligator pears.

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:13.211
Take all the alligator pears
and keep 'em. See if I care.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.340
Do you know how alligator pears are
made? Haven't the slightest idea.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:20.045
That's because you've never been an
alligator, and don't let it happen again.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.612
Do you know that it sometimes requires years
to bring the pear and the alligator together?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.453
They don't like each other.
No.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:29.723
No. Do you know how many alligator pears are sent out
of this state every year and told not to come back?

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.128
I don't think I do.
All they can get a hold of.
