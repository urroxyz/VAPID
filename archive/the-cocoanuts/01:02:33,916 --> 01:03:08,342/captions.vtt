00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.992
Wait a minute. You mean to say
that... That's enough. Come on.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.698
Please. Please don't take him.
What?

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:09.299
I didn't want you to steal it, Bob.
I had no idea that you'd do it.

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.436
Oh, I feel awful.
What are you talking about?

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.607
Bob, what does she mean?
Polly.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.276
<i>So that's
it. Oh, it's all my fault.</i>

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:22.550
I had no idea he'd think that I
meant it. I didn't want you to do it.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:26.821
I just meant that you could give
me one like it. Wait a minute.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.260
Are you accusing me
of taking Mrs. Potter's necklace?

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.426
I'm taking all the blame myself. I
was joking, and you took me seriously.
