We wanna see you, Mr. Hammer. What's
the matter? Somebody pay their bill?

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.537
We want our money. Yes, money.

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.700
You want your money?
We wanna get paid.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.973
Oh, you want my money? Is that
fair? Do I want your money?

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.482
Suppose George Washington's soldiers had asked
for money? Where would this country be today?

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.041
But they did ask.
And where's Washington?

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.113
No, my friends. No, money will never make you
happy, and happy will never make you money.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:26.182
That might be a wisecrack,
but I doubt it.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.490
We want our money.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:33.124
I'll make you all a promise. If you'll all stick
with me and work hard, we'll forget about money.
